I believe there are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the department to mentor the next wave of employees.

It will be difficult for the Senior Engineers and Senior Staff, but I believe it is do-able. The employees taking the position will likely be experienced enough to quickly adapt.

For the managers, only 2 are retiring so I don't think that will be a problem.
